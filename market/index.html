      <h2>Always Choose Good</h2>
      <p>When Maggie and I got married 60 years ago, we didn't have any 
        money. We had $ 8 in our bank account. For the first two years, we didn't
         even have a phone. We rented a tiny apartment in Venice, next to a gas station. My first phone was hanging there on the wall. I ran out to him, picked up the phone, and people thought they were calling me at home. There wasn't even a phone, 
        let alone a car. But do you know what we had? Love.</p>
